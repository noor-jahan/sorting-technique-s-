# <h1 align="center">Sorting Techniques ðŸ“¶</h1>

- <h3>Sorting</h3>  Sorting refers to arranging a set of data in some logical order.
- <h3>Sorting techniques </h3>   Sorting techniques allows an efficient arrangement of elements within a given data structure. It is a way in which the elements are organized systematically for some purpose.
- Sorting is among the most basic problems in algorithmic design.
